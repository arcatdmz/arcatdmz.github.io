        p I regularly work with graduate students who are interested in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and/or Programming Experience (PX) research.
        p Please contact me if you want to work with me. Keep in mind that, generally speaking, the first step toward working with professional researchers is often meeting them at academic conferences and get them know who you are and what you are doing.
        h3.ui.header Potential ways for collaborations
        p If you are living outside Japan, remote collaborations would be the easiest. If you have an appropriate visa, it would be possible for me to invite you to Tsukuba and work with you for a short term (e.g. regular internship programs for domestic students last for a month or so).
        p Otherwise, if you are still interested in face-to-face collaborations, we could together find visa and funding support. My affiliation currently has a funding from the 
          a(href='https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/accel/en/about/index.html') JST ACCEL
          |  program and there are also public funding support such as  
          a(href='http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-summer/')
            abbr(title='Japan Society for the Promotion of Science') JSPS
            |  Summer Program
          | .
        h3.ui.header Interested in staying in Japan?
        p Please note that there are currently multiple funding programs that could potentially support graduate students in the HCI research field to come to Japan and work with Japanese top researchers. Please refer to the following websites for more details.
