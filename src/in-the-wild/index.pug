  - title = 'Creativity support research &quot;in the wild&quot;';
  - description = 'Research on creativity support tools (CSTs) has long been conducted in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), but there is growing criticism that applied computer science, including HCI, has typically been conducted and evaluated in a limited cultural context, such as the fast-paced academic community and the WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and developed) part of the world. This poster presents recent efforts in creativity support research "in the wild", taking a longitudinal and constructive approach with the help of creators outside the research community to build computational tools for creative activities. Examples include TextAlive and its API for creating lyric-driven visual art [ACM CHI 2015, 2023] and Griffith for creating animation storyboards [ACM CHI 2024], both of which contribute to the discussion of how to develop human-centered AI that nurtures the creativity of people with diverse technical and cultural backgrounds.';
